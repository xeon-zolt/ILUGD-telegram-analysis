1) It is not possible as of now. By that I mean, theoretically it is possible but there is no app/feature built in for enabling or disabling this.
There is a feature though to disable/enable access to contacts on your phone for Android apps. But it works on global scope and not available right now for individual apps. 

2) SFOS has redefined how a user should interact with a phone. So if you come from Android/iOS land, you would find it hard to get started straight on. But there's a 5 min tutorial app built in. If anyone takes that 5 minutes tutorial, even an average Joe can use SFOS."

Xeon_Zolt,ILUG-D,2017-11-26T00:09:26,"I'd just like to interject for moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.
There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!"

Kuntal_Majumder,ILUG-D,2017-11-18T21:19:59,"True, Arch and Debian are just two popular distros among Linux Enthusiasts.."
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-11-18T21:18:32,"Xeon not everyone has time to read the manual. They want to work with the system, not spending time tweaking and configuring system everytime.

But many Arch users still do it. And I respect that fact and the users. 

Debian for me is kind of a bit of both worlds. Not too simple as Ubuntu, not too complex as Arch. Configure it the way you like and do some serious work on top of it."

karmanya_aggarwal,ILUG-D,2017-11-18T18:13:56,"I mean I get that it can be used, and kudos to you for doing that - but personally I like having some of the frills that the newer micros offer if I'm doing more sophisticated things. Even just a JTAG makes life significantly easier in my opinion."

Kuntal_Majumder,ILUG-D,2017-11-18T18:11:26,@rajudev so slow...
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-11-18T18:09:59,"Well, different people different opinions and point of views. 

I have used arduino in slightly bigger Robots measuring over a meter and weighing over 25 KGs. 

Also there was considerable complexity in terms of designing and interfacing of both mechanical and electronics aspects of it. 

I understand your point of view, but I believe that arduino is equally capable of being used in  robotics even on industrial scale."
karmanya_aggarwal,ILUG-D,2017-11-18T18:06:47,it fits the brief :)
Kuntal_Majumder,ILUG-D,2017-11-18T18:06:19,"@calmdownkarm, wow the username, exactly what I wanted to say"
karmanya_aggarwal,ILUG-D,2017-11-18T18:05:19,generalizing and unifying things would make it slightly more difficult to quickstart in my opinion
karmanya_aggarwal,ILUG-D,2017-11-18T18:04:56,"at least imo, in that brief it's amazing"
karmanya_aggarwal,ILUG-D,2017-11-18T18:04:39,"Right, but arduino isn't really intended for hardcore devs, it's more about the fact that it's easily accessible - to let people flash leds and play with servos immediately without necessarily understanding how electronics or code works"
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-11-18T17:37:04,The fact that anyone can develop a module along with its own library is more beneficial to the eco system. Although a pain sometimes for the coder.
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-11-18T17:34:03,I think overhead of reading libraries is fine for the modularity that the plug and play feature provided by the arduino ecosystem.
karmanya_aggarwal,ILUG-D,2017-11-18T17:23:12,"To be fair though, most arduino libraries are like 1 object and a small amount of functions. Things like this are almost inevitable given the plug and play nature Arduino was intended to have. I actually think if people want a gentle introduction to micros these days Mbed is significantly nicer from a dev point of view."
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-11-18T17:16:15,"Many times, along with writing code I have to open and read the whole source code of the libraries in order to use it efficiently along with my code."
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-11-18T17:14:03,Regarding different libraries for different components. That is a pain sometimes
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-11-18T17:13:26,"Regarding the points in the image. 
I only use the Arduino IDE when I need to to transfer the code to Arduino. 
To write my code I use either nano/micro/atom text editors. 
I find most other points true."

Shashank_Kumar,ILUG-D,2017-11-14T16:36:50,this is exactly what I don't want when I just need a plain and simple answer to what I search for.
karmanya_aggarwal,ILUG-D,2017-11-14T16:35:37,I'm just curious dude. I find it funny that people are more willing to use DDG than bing for most things - to the extent that bing actually tried to incentivize people to use it by offering some sort of point reward system.
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-11-14T16:25:40,can you give an example so that i can try
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-11-14T16:24:42,"if you wanna be a troll i am a game , what about it ?"
Pradhvan_Bisht,ILUG-D,2017-11-14T16:08:04,I meant like goggle has his maps and it's quite handy with the search engine. But you have to DDG some other map service even to find the nearest post office. But technically it's not about DDG when I think of it now. My bad.
karmanya_aggarwal,ILUG-D,2017-11-14T16:05:25,No bing hipsters in here?
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-11-14T16:01:45,What maps are you talking about in DDG ?
Shashank_Kumar,ILUG-D,2017-11-14T16:01:42,DuckDuckGo is faster than google. It does not jumble adds with search results.

In case of Termux, yes, Uninstalling the app would remove all the packages installed by it. It installs them in a sandbox, and that sandbox is part of app data, which is delete when an app is removed.

I might be wrong though. Anyone wanna correct me?"

Shashank_Kumar,ILUG-D,2017-11-07T16:58:53,I don't get it. Why create a clone of window's 98 in unix?

cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-11-07T14:46:08,"Ubuntu mate and linux mint are excellent choices firstly. Secondly, UM and LM will both stay out of your way, and let you get to work. Manjaro is pretty amazing too (and a personal favourite) but its more geared towards new users who wanna dig into Linux.

That bring said, once you understand Linux well enough, the distro doesn't matter that much. Want stability? Go for Debian. Want bleeding edge software? Arch/antergos/manjaro. Want security? Fedora or cent os  or open SUSE. You're paranoid and have shit loads of time? Gentoo, Slackware and lfs"

T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-11-03T18:10:39,I thought it was due to stdout but redirecting it to a file doesn't take up core

Sahil_Sharma,ILUG-D,2017-11-01T19:32:08,"For Linux Install Fest (First Time Users)
I would recommend that we do not install it for them, rather teach them how to do it. Starting from how to make bootable pen drives, how to open boot menu and change the boot order, then how to make partitions and install the OS. 
This can be done by forming groups of 4-5 people each, then giving them a demo on one of the system..so that they can try it on their own and if they get struck anywhere then we can help them out."

Kuntal_Majumder,ILUG-D,2017-10-30T22:20:00,we could accomodate more stickers if it is shrinked a little bit
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-10-30T22:19:36,Should be 1-2rs
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-10-30T22:19:18,That's 3rs per sticker

Sonu,ILUG-D,2017-10-29T22:57:40,"Boot from.windows usb, open cmd, type bootrec.exe /fixboot??
 If that doesn't fix it, I would advise against trying to remove it. I removed the Ubuntu BL from EFI partition and faced a locked bios. Had to replace the IC. Easiest method would be to format the disk all along. But considering you have important data on it, I advise you let it appear on boot menu."
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-10-29T22:43:03,Why do you want to remove GRUB. You probaly mean to remove an entry in GRUB Menu
Piyush_Malhotra,ILUG-D,2017-10-29T22:07:59,"How to remove GRUB?
Like, I formatted mint partition and has to remove the bootloader now.
How do I do it?

Ps: i tried google stuffs(bootrec.exe) and deleting it from BIOS, but it's still there."

Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-10-29T11:40:41,since at the root prompt you won't have network connectivity to do it.

TL;DR;
the thing is that used used ubuntu 17.04 as my primary os , and i could connect to an access point namely AP913, if  by chance or some reason , if this connection got disrupted . then it would not connect untill i would manually forget the connection [ i.e. delete the saved credential entry [using gui] ]  , only then it used to connect again.
some time later even this trick/jugad stoped working .
but i must tell it worked better in windows and kali.
this led me to believe that it has something to do with drivers .
although i did not look for the appropriate drivers then.
not the problem is that i am finally in a windows session and the device is connected[ i just noticed , lol]
but after some time i will definitely get disconnected and once it gets disconnected fom AP913 , it will not be able to connect to AP913 , and at the same time will easily connect to AP912 [which offers a lower speed]"

initially it created problems in Ubuntu 17.04 , but worked fine in kali and windows.Later it stopped working in windows too . unfortunately i do not have kali in my machine anymore .

i am guessing it is some hardware problem . What are your thoughts on this , guys ?

"" ANDROBOTS ""
An amazing platform where you get to design your own bots & contribute towards automating as many mundane tasks as possible. 

- The participants have to design their own bots at the venue and present their bots. 

For the backend of the bot you could use an API(such as api.ai) or code it using Python,node js etc & for front end you can either use a messaging platform (like Telegram, SLACK)or you can build an android app etc.  

It could be anything from a sensor bot, customer support chat bots, a fun Emojify bot, horoscope bot & what not! 

Think out ot the box, Showcase your coding skills & come out with an 'extraordinary product'.

Innovation is the key ! 

So stop thinking...& start building !

Join us on 24th Oct 2017 and let's tread on together in this techie ride of bots!

If you really want to use Kali, use it in a VM. It is not meant to be your host OS as it is terribly insecure. 

If you don't want to use Kali, and are looking for something bleeding edge, you may as well try Antergos. Or any other mainstream distribution that's not Kali.

[_matrix_],ILUG-D,2017-10-13T01:01:01,Yash Bhardwaj: what i our theme for the next meet-up ? is it decided yet?
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-10-13T00:59:50,As an example. We had an issue on kicad by Aurabindo. But we didn't select it for last meetup because we wanted a theme suitable for beginners.
[_matrix_],ILUG-D,2017-10-13T00:59:10,Yash Bhardwaj: can docker be discussed in the next meetup please ?
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-10-13T00:58:32,It is usually selected based on the theme that we want to put in for a particular meetup. Also depending on the time frame we have for a particular meetup

[_matrix_],ILUG-D,2017-10-13T00:56:39,Yash Bhardwaj: so the issue is selected on the basis of comments ans responses/reactions
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-10-13T00:56:07,There are also buttons for like and smile and stuff there.

There are a few access points outside my room , when i am logged in through windows or kali i am able to easily connect to AP13 , but i can't do the same from windows .
Infact it shows less signal strength . I have checked the wifi card txpower its set to 30mW. I'm unable to figure out why it is so . Any thoughts or solutions?

If the doubt is inappropriate for the group please let me know."

Manpreet_Nehra,ILUG-D,2017-10-11T10:46:45,how many people do we expect?
Manpreet_Nehra,ILUG-D,2017-10-11T10:46:34,"I am not saying tis requreid I thinking from point of view of people in Satellite towns, going from one satellite town to another takes 2 hrs and if the meet is for 4hrs that's 4 hrs of travel for 4 hrs of meetup. not very ""efficient"" use of time. Especially for working people. But otherwise we use what's available :)"
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-10-11T10:44:26,we will try our best to get venue near Rajiv chowk or any other central location
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-10-11T10:43:37,That  would be great if  we can have something like that
Manpreet_Nehra,ILUG-D,2017-10-11T10:41:56,even if its the same location everytime something within 60-90 mins of travel is the best location
Manpreet_Nehra,ILUG-D,2017-10-11T10:39:25,minimum number of changes and Raji Chowk is centrally located anything within a few stations ther would bea  good venue for everyone
Manpreet_Nehra,ILUG-D,2017-10-11T10:38:57,"If we are looking for everyone taking almost the same time or  minimum time, something closer to cp would be best,"
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-10-11T10:33:09,we will have a few handson workshops then. ?

Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-10-11T10:28:11,till then review the issues on git for talks.
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-10-11T10:27:45,lets wait for other's views on this.
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-10-11T10:27:17,We can either ask for Srijan or Csds or any other central venue ?
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-10-11T10:26:20,Cool
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-10-11T10:25:38,from my side it is fine. But I think if we can get a central location where everyone needs to travel less would be better.
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-10-11T10:24:20,So we will prefer venues in Noida. Right?
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-10-11T10:23:43,Okay

Just use a text editor to write your programs and a terminal to execute your programs."

Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-10-07T01:43:59,Since the first session is a talk. The second session is more of an Installation preview. A talk after that would create a balance between Talks/Practial sessions. [That's just my opinion]
Vipul_Gupta,ILUG-D,2017-10-07T01:42:06,I just did refer to it. Shouldn't it be before the installation demo. Since all the talks after installation demo have already been assigned.

Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-10-06T21:57:42,The install fest is usually an informal event. No one would be able to listen to one person there as that is not the usual format
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-10-06T21:56:01,"I don't know anything about him and have not met him as well. 
We can surely get him some time for speaking. 

But looking at the tight schedule we have,  he needs to make sure that it is short and crisp. Probably around 10m could be adjusted in the schedule anywhere.

If he agrees to speak for the duration, then it's fine. 

Again this is just my opinion, if you guys think that we can get more time to him somehow then go ahead."

Hello all, reminder & updates about the implementation of issue tracker mechanism for open designs

We have a group 'Open Design' in code.swecha.org(self-hosted GitLab[https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq])

For better organization, I'm proposing to segregate design requests into 3 projects.

Project 1: Branding
Style Guides and Logos will be part of this project.

Project 2: 2D graphics
Posters/banners for events/announcement/info-graphics etc. will be part of this project.
[this project will take style info inputs from Project 1: Branding]

Project 3: 3D
3D designs for 3D printing, Vitural Reality and Augmented Reality etc will be part of this project.

Please suggest your improvisations/critique on these to re-organize or propose new projects."

Firstly, a lot of embedded Linux systems don't bother with higher level functions like graphical interfaces or package management and stuff (some do), so they aren't a complete guide to learn linux.

Amit_Kumar_Jaiswal,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:56:48,@Joinalahmed Let's have a look at one of my last slide on rust: http://amitkumarj441.github.io/Presentation/Rust

Amit_Kumar_Jaiswal,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:55:31,Actually I am not interested in community building because if lots of side work and open source involvements and don't you know I was the one who has been choosen as Rust India laision (officially by Servo compiler creator during Mozilla Summit 2016) but you know people in India are less toward code contribution and Mehul and their friends are just evangelizing about Rust with no-code
Amit_Kumar_Jaiswal,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:51:28,I know very well mehul
Joinal,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:50:49,You Know Mehul Patel? @amitkumarjaiswal
Amit_Kumar_Jaiswal,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:50:35,"Ohh...Drats!
I am flying on 4th November to Sydney and will be unavailable till 15th"
Amit_Kumar_Jaiswal,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:49:44,What are the tracks because I will get bored on beginner topics and their are lots of noise going around parity(for which I can speak)
Joinal,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:47:46,@amitkumarjaiswal  November 1st week
Amit_Kumar_Jaiswal,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:45:58,"Cool. I am one of rust-webplatform maintainer and servo contributer.
I would love to speak but need to know about the dates because I have very tight schedules this year."
Srihari_Unnikrishnan,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:40:39,What I think is that people have a genuine fear of breaking their computers and not getting proper software support when it comes to Linux. I think we should break that
Manas_kashyap,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:39:08,"yes , and just by talk and telling them what is foss wont help them , a handson and teaching them some things like how to work in terminal , basic commands and all this is useful for them"
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:37:35,"My point is:
Simply giving a talk about foss and it's benefit would not do anything. One needs to understand the people and connect at a more grassroot level.

Perfect example of this:
http://pradeepto.livejournal.com/18619.html"
Manas_kashyap,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:36:57,a person who just know linux is a operating system and never used it for any work
Srihari_Unnikrishnan,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:36:46,Oh
Manas_kashyap,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:36:29,"a person who is new to linux but loves technology annd not been guided properly how to shift from dumb windows machines to linux ,"
Manas_kashyap,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:35:01,please involve me too for this purpose
Manas_kashyap,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:34:50,"cool , then i can help in this too ,"
Srihari_Unnikrishnan,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:34:08,How would you define a beginner
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:33:29,"In many workshops I have seen that some of the people are not able to understand stuff or too afraid to ask something. 
Since we at ILUG-D were already planning to do workshops in colleges/school for the benefit of students and introducing to foss, we should cater the content according to the audience"
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:30:11,Linux install fest is a must(2-3 hrs is enough for it) and would be fun.
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-09-23T21:29:22,"Since a lot of kids will be quite new to many concepts, this meetup should be very beginners friendly."

cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-09-19T10:32:03,Yeah. I guess that makes sense
Manpreet_Nehra,ILUG-D,2017-09-19T10:31:41,sicne if you use an external URL to obtain your IP it will always be an external IP routed or hosted won't mattter
Manpreet_Nehra,ILUG-D,2017-09-19T10:31:12,that's why ifconfig.me is useful
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-09-19T10:30:57,Hmm. Imma google for a while. thanks
Manpreet_Nehra,ILUG-D,2017-09-19T10:30:17,if you are using a FTTH and using your machine with 2 network cards then it might give you external IP based on what your first device is
Manpreet_Nehra,ILUG-D,2017-09-19T10:29:41,so you get internal IP
Manpreet_Nehra,ILUG-D,2017-09-19T10:29:33,at home you are almost always solo homed and your external IP is hosted on your router
Manpreet_Nehra,ILUG-D,2017-09-19T10:29:16,if your server is multihomed then your first interface might be your exsternal on your server
Manpreet_Nehra,ILUG-D,2017-09-19T10:28:58,that depends on your device order

Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:44:34,@rajudev feel free to help @warlord77 for this
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:43:38,least let's see you do some constructive work and not put it on some one else
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:43:11,@warlord77 give me a write up about ILUG-D and where it is headed that people can read when some one introduces ILUG-D
Rajat_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:42:24,may be @rajudev

Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:41:03,@rajat please do that
Rajat_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:40:22,@warlord77 if there is that much confussion then we can call the community names one by one and tell them to share their word?
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:39:51,if you give your speaker @akash47 can pu them on the schedule
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:39:17,let's start with that
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:39:09,so @warlord77 get us the person who will speak for ILUG-D
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:38:32,@Quanon is not the only organizer. It is a community event.
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:38:01,@warlord77 we are all organising SFD
Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:37:42,I only meant as the organiser of SFD @Quanon will make sure that nothing goes wrong
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:37:35,least the one who will speak for your group? @warlord77
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:37:17,do you have even your speaker organised
Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:36:49,no one knows where the speaker is .. then you have to run around and find the speaker or get his status where he is
Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:36:13,yup i went through the whole thread even realise if we dont have proper schedul/timing for community it will become hochpoch like last times mash up meetup
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:35:33,where/how  do you have a misunderstanding of what is written down clearly?
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:35:05,it's even mentioned in the schedule
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:34:57,talk has to be about Software freedom
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:34:46,Context was already made clear
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:34:24,did you even read the Question? It was about format for speakers

Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:10:16,@rajudev they are going to talk before the other groups. Remember the schedule you posted?
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:06:53,Okay.
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:05:44,@akash47 take the task to assign some one who you think is responsible enough to talk about ILUG-D on SFD
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:05:06,@cocoa1231 ?
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-09-14T19:04:54,I might not be able to make it to the meetup.

chargE,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T23:39:58,The first part of the day is the communities introducing themselves :|
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T23:37:21,Schedule looks gut
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T23:37:08,http://sfdphilippines.org/
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T23:32:56,Dev-sprint is cool.
chargE,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T23:32:14,(you mean audience interaction I guess)
chargE,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T23:31:57,Like?
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T23:31:32,There should be some activities too in sfd.
Peeyush_Aggarwal,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:40:18,"@Phi_mb I was just joking about that channel. As far as paid stuff goes, different people put there resources differently at work."
Phi_mb,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:39:17,"Mostly like java, android and all..."
chargE,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:38:16,What stuff do they have _trainings_ for?
Phi_mb,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:37:25,"Ok, but the frequency for internship post are less."
Banana,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:36:53,Yes.
Pradhvan_Bisht,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:36:40,Yup some people do actually.
chargE,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:36:10,Oh that training. Do people really give money for stuff they can learn online?
Pradhvan_Bisht,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:36:07,"Try JustJobs , they do have some internships"
Phi_mb,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:35:21,I guess internship channel would be more helpful.
Pradhvan_Bisht,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:30:48,Most of the people here don't prefer though paid trainings. As most of them are self taught though googling and reading docs.
Peeyush_Aggarwal,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:27:56,( in this group as well )
Peeyush_Aggarwal,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:27:45,Do pin spamming policies .
Peeyush_Aggarwal,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:27:09,As the name suggest. Just training üòÇüòÇ
Shashank_Kumar,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:26:48,Will look into it üòä
chargE,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:24:39,What would just trainings have :|
Peeyush_Aggarwal,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:22:53,Honour is all yours
Shashank_Kumar,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:22:26,No we don't. I would be cool to create one though.
Peeyush_Aggarwal,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:21:46,@realslimshanky do we have a just trainings channel like just jobs?
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:14:22,"Phew, I wish I had a TL DR for this one."
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:14:06,"If anyone else here can suggest speakers or talk at the event, it would be great."
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:13:21,"Akshay, it would be great if you could talk to other communities and ask them the same thing."
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:12:55,Raju devidas is already in contact with one such speaker. I will leave it upto him to tell us what the speaker can talk about at the event.
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:12:31,"Since its a collaborative event, ILUGD would like to actively help out in organizing it.
In addition to the groups talking about what software freedom means to them, We would like to hold atleast 2 talks on educating the audience about software freedom and privacy."
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:11:31,Talks by other communities talking about what software freedom means for their group is good but it still doesnt tell the audience what software freedom should mean to them. It doesnt tell them why they should care about it in the first place.
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:10:10,There is no mention of any dedicated activity which seeks to educate the audience about software freedom and the right to privacy.
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:09:56,Some members feel that the current setup of SFD is not aligned with the values the event actually intends to promote.
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T22:08:57,@Quanon Hi
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T21:37:17,Look at the audience
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T21:12:20,"Since you found it so funny, will you also tell me why is it so funny?"

Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T00:22:40,Okay.
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T00:22:25,"I had asked the same from these other groups, and got a positive response from them"
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T00:21:18,but if you want to do a separate one then that is ok too
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T00:21:02,"yes, it still should be"
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-09-09T00:20:37,Umm. Wait a minute. Wasn't 16th supposed to be a combined meetup for both the communities and any other who would join in ?
chargE,ILUG-D,2017-09-08T23:49:57,That would be pretty cool
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-08T23:49:44,ofcourse if you want it to be a combined meetup then you folks are welcome for that too.
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-09-08T23:49:25,"this does not have to be a combined meetup, you just need to send one or 2 representatives from your community to speak about your community"

Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-09-08T00:01:39,I am concerned of the co-ordination between them. It might happen that something takes place which a particular group might not agree on. I don't intend any rifts with anybody.
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-09-08T00:00:27,We can announce the event now. And update the meetup details later.

SFD would be widely observed around the world on the same day too.
For those of you who are not aware of what SFD is, visit [1]. The wikipedia entry [2] might be useful too.

Our plan is to conduct talks which educate the attendees on what free software actually is and why does software freedom matter.

T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-09-02T00:15:11,"Deb Richardson started LinuxChix because she was tired of seeing new users being browbeaten for asking stupid questions. She was tired of seeing people respond to perfectly valid questions with RTFM, we're not a Linux help channel, and other such not-terribly-useful things. She wanted to attempt to create a more hospitable community in which people can discuss Linux, a community that encourages participation and that doesn't allow the quieter among us to be drowned out by the vocal minority. She also wanted to run a group that was aimed at women."

That's completely unambiguous..
Why do you need to install a base system into a file system of another system? 
Why can't I just mount the target file system and then bind all the special directories (/proc, /dev, /sys) and just chroot?"

You MUST have a debian unstable system (physical, virtual machine or a container) lxc If you already have a GNU/Linux system, lxc would be the easiest to setup.

Saurabh_Kumar,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:55:19,"I don't think you can make anyone(a.k.a. everyone) shift anywhere, just start using new one and drop email to old one saying people have moved on."
Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:53:46,It's just like we need to make sure that everyone shifts to Google groups and start using it
Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:53:16,No we don't
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:52:40,Focus on getting the word out about the present one
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:52:19,"Forget about the old its gone , think about what you can build may be by writing regularly that we have moved from the old mailing list"
Saurabh_Kumar,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:51:58,"I had a understanding that googlegroups acts as a mailing list, do we need to have 2 of these?"
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:50:42,"They are old archives
 it doesn't have any recent archives
Like 2016-2017"
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:48:52,We can make an attempt to get the mailing list and parallely we can start using google groups.
Saurabh_Kumar,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:47:53,Archives at https://www.mail-archive.com/ilugd@lists.linux-delhi.org/
Saurabh_Kumar,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:46:20,The website currently redirects to http://frodo.hserus.net/mailman/listinfo/ilugd it should have been to google groups.
Saurabh_Kumar,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:45:51,I don't see how having another mailing list area helps then?
Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:45:14,But most of the folks are still on old mailing list
Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:44:58,Yup it was decided
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:44:07,"Yes i know that person and the list , ok was it not decided to stick with Google groups and  make it grow"
Guneet,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:43:54,+1 for Google groups. It works just fine
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:42:57,"Actually, We don't know him.
Only Kishore or may be @Satyaakam  knows him.
He is hosting and managing many mailings list.
We already have have google group.
But it lacks outreach.
 our current mailing list has great outreach.
For example I got a mail from someone living in some village near Aligarh asking for linux related help and installation cds."
Rajat_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:42:11,Hello guys. Just a reminder. Every volunteer needs a ticket to attend PyCon. Please buy one if you haven't still https://bit.ly/PyConIndiaTickets
Saurabh_Kumar,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:34:33,"Has anyone tried to get in touch with this 'someone' and/or tried to get proper access. In terms of archival issue, I think google groups should do just fine."

Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:08:19,Docker or anything again is the tech its not something we are very choosy or disagrrements with its how we can get the Human element out of the equation is i think the whole discussion about IMHO
johndoe,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:06:55,/me doesn't see things wrong with static pages on github.io but pitches in docker for wiki :p
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:06:00,"I agree.
But keeping a simple infrastructure will always  help both us and the new generation.
We are not certain about who will be managing it in future.
So, I think it is good to have simplistic infrastructure."
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:02:14,"It is managed by someone‚Äã.
It doesn't archives the mails
plus we don't have access to it.
We lack the proper sync up"
Guneet,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:00:48,Agreed
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:00:39,Infrastructure also should be owned by multiple individuals
Guneet,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:00:37,"Nice, i like self qoutes üòÑ"
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:00:23,think this way
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T10:00:03,"my focus is on the sustainability again i don't care a shit about tech , as i said multiple times "" Technology is easy to pick and make it run people are the most diffcult to deal with and community sufferes because of few """
Guneet,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T09:59:07,Use github for it
Guneet,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T09:59:02,"Wiki is a good idea, there should be one. It can also cover the part of how to manage whatever IT infrastructure the community has"
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T09:58:31,Two communities suffered in past because of folks died Ilugd and PSSI
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T09:58:09,"@guneetnarula @Satyaakam 
We like the idea of wiki because it has some ease 
But again if that idea doesn't full fill the original purpose then it always good to drop it."
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T09:57:26,it too has happened in Past Tirveni knows about it too
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T09:56:22,All the infrastructure should always be owned by multiple folks remember we too have a expiry date !!
Saurabh_Kumar,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T09:55:43,What are the issues
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T09:55:00,"@theskumar @Satyaakam 
Thanks a lot
Another idea is to shift mailing list to the same server offered by Tirveni.
Current mailing list has some issues.
What's your suggestions"
Guneet,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T09:51:03,"Another idea, if the community wishes to experiment with different things online, is to point a subdomain to a private server and do all the experiments there. The main site can continue on something that does not require lots of commitment or any kind of sponsorship. What do you say @Satyaakam"
Guneet,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T09:49:18,Wiki on github should do well like Saurabh suggested.
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T09:48:23,No that should not dscourage folks from doing things
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T09:47:26,"Then we will drop this idea.
We need to find how we can integrate things."
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T09:29:09,"again -1 for any idividual sponsoring domain names and server space it works well for 1-2 years then you start seeing cracks both in the maintenance as well as individual commitment , seen even though individual commitment is there, there aint anyone to own the things and drive them read more on ""tragedy of commons""  more on the lines of knowledge commons so we need to think in a creative ways since on multiple instances seen in past it does not work and it won't now as well. So lets explore the ideas @theskumar is pointing to. yes we can arugue endlessless again Github not being FOSS and one day they will also cease to exist i would say the probablity is low since they are making money and doing some good on there way.i recall there was project http://freedomboxfoundation.org/ don't know whats it status is now ? it can be a potential solution too ."
Saurabh_Kumar,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T09:09:11,"For wiki, GitHub offers a wiki."
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T09:06:35,"We will have public repo and everything will be automated.

It is sponsored by Tirveni.
We can totally drop this idea if we can figure out some other alternative.
The idea of wiki is adopted just for ease. if it causes us extra overhead and burden then it will be wrong decision.
Please suggest some other alternatives.
We only need some more sections in the website and something that can be easily handled."
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T08:56:48,"We can drop this idea.
Is there any other alternative
for wikis?"
Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T07:37:13,+1
Saurabh_Kumar,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T07:21:04,"Unless you have a mechanism to automatically test and then deploy on the infra via public repository without human intervention, don't do this.

The cost and ownership of infrastructure can't be individuals responsibility as well. It has to be self sustaining either via sponsorship or via other means."
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T07:12:23,I recall IIT Delhi lug website and old ILUGDelhi they tried the same move it was a maintenance overhead in few years you all will be on your way to whatever and slowly the website dies seen the same trend in ILUGC as well. Make sure this does not happen
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-28T03:11:48,"you can find all the points under the heading ""discussion"""

Then probbaly you dont belong here. I'd like the admins to clarify what is the primary motive of this group. Satyakam Goswami (Telegram) and friends came here first, so they should be knowing what this group was made for. So if I am overstepping, communicate it clearly"

That is a choice i have. What power do you have to refrain me from doing so ? For example, When I say ""RISC-V is a good alternative to ARM"" and try to explain its advantages over other architectures, you have a few options - 1) be curious and understand what I'm telling makes sense, or 2) if you're convinced that you do not agree with it, you can argue back solely on the technical merit of it. 3) Ignore the discussion and carry on with your work
But the statement you just made, makes it personal. ""Else I will leave folks to there wisdom"" Do you realize that you're sort of threatening? And do I care you leave or not? Absolutely not. Argue on the technical merits or demerits of a technology. Not on personal actions. They are pointless, and waste of time. Rather, if you are arguing on technical topics, people watching the discussion might learn a thing or two."

Did the messages in this group explode because of matrix integration? If I had joined this group as a telegram user itself, would you be having this conversation ? I dont understand, having a bot in here that is not disturbing you in any way is irritating you ?

> 
> Matrix Bridge is such a Pro Free Software idea and why is it encouraged and pushed through our throat here on this channel ?
> 
I am not a pro free software evangelist. I'm a privacy advocate. I dont prefer to use the term free software. I only used the term open source. For hardcore free software fans, there is Free Software Community of India channel in both matrix, and irc with around 200 people. Look up the difference. Free softrware, Open source software & hardware, Linux, they all go hand in hand.
If it was me explaining about matrix that irritated all of you in here, well, then all I can tell is that I am totally disappointed in all of you. If you cannot keep an open mind or if you have too much resistance to change, you will NEVER thrive in technological career. I believe most of you are students here. My suggestion, is to try out various technologies, analyze and then decided whether its good for you or not. Biased dismissal of technology is not the best action a learned enginner would do. Id like to ask, those who are revolting against matrix here, have you took time to understand what it is? Have you visited its website? Like I said, if your intention joining this group is to learn, be inquisitive."

Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:52:47,@Satyaakam in terms of energy waist for this bridging was zero because @aurabindo uses only matrix it was his effort and he bridged the telegram to matrix
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:50:13,i would not take this bait seen these many over and out for now
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:49:42,hey now you are getting to a point of aruging for the sake for argument üòä
Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:49:08,Energy and effort are never waisted
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:49:08,i think you have missed the whole point and the arugument we are here discussing about communications not comunity
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:48:17,try and give me a number in one months time from now then we would talk again on this experiment
Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:48:15,Its a community people come and do these things for the community
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:47:49,so my point is its not that effort and energy can be used in other areas
Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:47:38,We haven't bridged irc yet
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:47:20,my guess would 1 or max 2
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:47:09,"my point it leave at that and work on building quality than quantity all that i have seen so far has been work on quantity , do you have a number how many people from IRC are interacting because of this ?"
Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:47:08,1 app for all ur channels irc/matrix/telegram it's called riot
Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:46:38,It's all about saving the time
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:45:45,"go ahead if you have all the time in the world to use one zillion other too , i am not one of them and would use it with caution"
Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:45:41,@Satyaakam every irc channel has been bridged to matrix / telegram channel to increase the user engagement because ppl who use irc hesitate to move to any other channe
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:44:44,"For me Computers, internet , phone all are means to an end"
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:44:25,i am not saying this is good or bad all that i am saying is how to differentiate between information and actionable items and take it to logical end with a Human is the channel no tools in this world can solve by just tools
Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:44:16,I don't know about you or others but there are quite a lot of us who use riot for all our needs from speaking to OSS communities in irc
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:43:08,is my point of view
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:42:59,so what i say is uncounciously we all are getting sucked into this whirlpool will little getting done
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:42:10,"i would not agree with the idea , the problem with this generation is information is good but they do not know how much is too much remember you need processing time then learning time and then applying time for the information to be useful to anyone"
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:40:41,Linux India on IRC is dead so no point in doing that
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:40:14,"No its lot of Noise i see clearly except few guys nobody is contributing to the coolective , why add the Matrix thing my argument is what is the value is it bringing when the same person is talking and can talk from here using a telegram client ?"
Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:38:40,Such that 1platform which connects all the different channels
Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:38:18,If u. Can get the irc ops we can bridge Linux India irc with our telegram channel
Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-08-25T06:37:38,So u say we shouldn't have bridged d channels?

Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-08-24T22:13:10,"I agree with the points except point 2.
- Certificates are not a good enough incentive, we get not so genuine people interested only in the certificate. It does not guarantee quality of talks nor audience.

Below points just for arguments sake :
- we are not a registered organisation. Idk if we are eligible to give one.
- All of us running this meetup are not that experienced to be judges, and getting an experienced person having enough free time at every meetup would be difficult."

- reaching out to  LUG heads, profs, ""oss companies"" and other ""technologists"" is a nice way. 
- Providing certificates(digital) to students giving presentations
- Themed meetups( at last meet, most came for hardware stuff)
- Planning agenda at the meet itself by asking people (which would create engagement and help in ""theme-ing"")"
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-08-24T21:09:07,Sounds good but would be difficult in practice since we dont have any financial backing.

Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-24T11:56:18,i would NO
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-24T11:56:15,so will we say they do not have some sort of package management

Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-24T11:53:28,They actually do

Why do the mehnath
Why not it be on single place
You dont care if people join this group or not

You are not doing any extra work because of Matrix integration into this group
What if govt. decides to block telegram for whatever reason (they have done this for whatsapp in various situations in india). You dont really want the power of communication in one single entity - be it private or govt."

Usually in technical group chats, if you need somepone's attention, you mention their username so that they get alerted.

[_matrix_],ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:29:52,rajudev: now you know that Matrix exists and it is being extensively used as well
[_matrix_],ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:29:30,rajudev: but what if I can join the same group irrespective of the service I choose to join it..
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:28:59,and I even don't know Matrix exists
[_matrix_],ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:28:33,"rajudev: Exactly. Why should one join different platforms for a similar group, be it Telegram/Matrix/Slack/IRC ?"
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:27:49,"in all and all, managing one thing is much easier and if they have to join that gp on their fav app/platform, why not on Telegram only (note: I am NOT saying we restrict to Telegram itself only, I am just saying)"
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:26:44,"like Telegram ( which techie does not use it), Slack (am not there and I personally don't like it), IRC (Telegram is the new IRC)"
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:26:14,"if we are ultimately linking, why not just be on  at most 2 or 3 platforms"
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:25:51,"Because that would make what we are seeing now, we will have to connect each and every single thing"
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:25:29,why?
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:25:26,there are a huge number of platforms to gather but it is not really a good option to be a gp on every single one of them
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:24:52,th thing is
[_matrix_],ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:24:35,"rajudev: go ahead, I am listening"
[_matrix_],ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:24:17,rajudev: It is just that some people are choosing a different approach to join the group
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:24:00,the problem is a different one
[_matrix_],ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:23:49,"rajudev: If 10 new users would have joined in Telegram group, they would have generated the same number of messages."
[_matrix_],ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:23:08,rajudev: although IRC is not implemented yet
Rajat_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:22:35,ohhh thats the way
Harsh_Shandilya,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:22:19,K
[_matrix_],ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:22:06,rajudev: It is not duplicating the number of messages that I send
[_matrix_],ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:21:36,rajudev: Now I am chatting via Matrix

Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:20:54,As an experiment and example. I can converse to this group using Telegram or by using riot
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:20:52,I have one proposal though
Rajat_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:20:18,üëçüèª
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:20:17,matrix is also a messaging platform just like telegram
Rajat_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:20:11,k
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:20:00,see it works this way
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:19:49,It's not my call. It is our call. I am discussing this to make you understand . Before you give your decision you should understand the situation
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:19:29,you may say I am putting my feet too deep being relatively new but I do want to be able to a part
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:18:42,same from here
Rajat_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:18:32,baki Its your call
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:18:27,Its a bot who delivers message from an actual person
Rajat_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:18:22,so @rajudev bhai bot and person mein difference h
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:18:02,its a bot
Rajat_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:17:54,@rajudev this matrix is a person or bot just clear my confussion first
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:17:54,you cannot control anyone but a bot
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:17:46,maybe not but the reason would be different
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:17:02,"If a person has joined via telegram, would your response have been the same?"
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:16:24,right. I am discussing this with you to arrive on a conclusion
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:15:53,"that is not a solution, right?"
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:15:30,"okay, I understand your issue here. I also think on the same line. But what do you propose a solution for this. Should we bar new people from joining the group?"
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:14:30,600 msgs are overwhelming for anyone
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:13:28,"when there are like 200 msgs, we can read but when they get multiplied by 2 or 3, going through like 400 or 600 msgs makes the mood off and all the msgs are ignored"
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:13:07,and is it that we are having any off-topic non-related conversation anywhere?
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:12:44,and the but here is a big one
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:12:38,"it is, BUT"
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:12:12,isn't having conversations the whole purpose of a group?
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:10:56,more or less I was saying the same
Rajat_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:10:27,waise hi din k 400 msg ni padhe jaate upar se ye aa gaya h to 600 kar dega
Rajat_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:10:04,bhai ise remove kar de
[_matrix_],ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:09:57,Aurabindo: ok
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T22:09:24,Aurabindo: it is not available yet. We are in process of getting the OP status

Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T21:56:42,The whole point of bridging is to be able to communicate with a group irrespective of the service you want to use.
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T21:55:11,IRC bridging coming soon
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-08-22T21:55:01,Riot and Telegram are bridged now

The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:26:49,:)
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:26:45,"there you have it, both ways - ftell and fseek AND lseek and lseek"
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:26:30,"1. Use ftell then calc the diff between addresses and then seek that much using fseek
2. Use lseek (fd, SEEK_SET, 0). This will tell you current location, then use lseek to seek to that address"
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:25:36,TWO options
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:25:14,"(I already use fseek, so no need for lseek, which is low-level as described by you)"
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:24:36,"I have a memory address. I want to seek to that specific address, can I do that."
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:24:07,üòÇüòÇ Apologies. I wasn't clear.
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:23:53,that is how it answers
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:23:46,"so, yes, one can seek"
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:23:41,you asked can one seek to a memory address
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:23:23,"when you seek from the last byte in lseek, you jump some bytes and the file is said to have holes which do not take space on disk"
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:23:13,"Yes, but how does this helps my question is what I'm asking. @rinne_parad0x"
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:22:39,"in python you could 
file_desc.seek( int(address, 16))"
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:22:37,"you have 3 args, first open file descriptor of the file you want to use lseek on, second - no of bytes you want to seek (+ve for forward, -ve for backward) third - you want to seek from current position or from the beginning or from current position or from the end of the file"
Harsh_Shandilya,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:21:13,python.........
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:20:51,"Yes, fseek also takes offset but from 0 to file size. What does the offset in lseek means?"
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:20:43,I am out of those 2
Harsh_Shandilya,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:20:12,talk java or android plz

Harsh_Shandilya,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:19:53,...
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:19:44,lseek is a system call which works on file descriptor and I believe fseek is a glibc wrapper for this system call which works on a FILE pointer
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:18:24,How is it different from fseek?
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:11:30,though I don't think you are trying to seek from the last position in the file
The_Legendary_Uchiha,ILUG-D,2017-08-21T23:11:16,"btw you can also have holes while working in the file, make sure to take care of them"

Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-08-17T17:08:31,because someone might want to open multiple sections of the website. opening in the same tab will take the user away from the web page

Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-08-15T20:32:09,"@arcsaber those were just my views. I framed them keeping in mind the feedbacks we received. There are few number of proposals at lug than in Pydelhi. We can't afford to reject any proposal, but by having more time we can:
- help speaker prepare talk in a way more suited to the audience , as the volunteers are collecting the stats of the audience. Adding content along the way.
- there was feedback to help new speakers to practice before the talk. Be it 2hrs or a day or week before the meetup.
- cost for tea & snacks are borne by the volunteers. Till we implement another feedback received regarding funds, having monthly meetup costs half.

Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-08-14T11:41:55,there still exists a issue on why the numbers seem to be rounded off and not exact...
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-08-14T11:41:32,thought this was quite obvious though why would % use be for overall disk size? why compare %use from one partition of different size to another of diff size?
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-08-14T11:38:13,this can be explained by rounding off %tages and use being based on size of partition not on overall size of the disk.

Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-14T07:04:21,This is from a  old friend of mine ^^
Satyakam_Goswami,ILUG-D,2017-08-14T07:03:42,"I noticed something unusual today on my disk. Can someone explain
why/how this
¬†happens ?¬† I was just trying to take a look at my system, using df.
This is what I saw :

Filesystem¬† ¬† ¬† Size¬† Used Avail Use% Mounted on
devtmpfs¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 1.9G¬† ¬† ¬†0¬† 1.9G¬† ¬†0% /dev
tmpfs¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†1.9G¬† 264K¬† 1.9G¬† ¬†1% /dev/shm
tmpfs¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†1.9G¬† ¬†11M¬† 1.9G¬† ¬†1% /run
tmpfs¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†1.9G¬† ¬† ¬†0¬† 1.9G¬† ¬†0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/sda3¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 50G¬† 9.0G¬† ¬†38G¬† 20% /
/dev/sda1¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†156M¬† 4.5M¬† 152M¬† ¬†3% /boot/efi
/dev/sda4¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†453G¬† ¬†11G¬† 442G¬† ¬†3% /home
/dev/sda5¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†411G¬† ¬†71M¬† 390G¬† ¬†1% /extra

¬†sda5 uses on 71 M out of 411 G but it shows 1%.¬† which itself is
arithmetically wrong. At the same time, sda4 has used 11G out of 453 G,
it shows only 3 % used. This is inconsistent with the percentage used by
sda5 (11G cannot be 3 times 71M). What is happening in my case (and why
does this happen only to me ) ? Or, is df cheating me ?

Can someone guide this old maths teacher ?"

Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-08-04T16:43:51,"well, it might be because of the differences in how packages are kept and managed on debian repositories. as well the implementation of apt"

Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-08-04T16:32:24,This is what I do. 1. Make a new directory  for the chroot. 2. Debootstrap the os to the newly created directory 3. cd .. out of the directory when debootstrap is finished 4. sudo chroot <directory name> 5. chroot just works at this point

Secondly, at least from my experience, apt breaks a lot more than pacman. I mean, pacman has not broken on me since I installed this installation 4/5 months ago. In contrast, I tried using Debian in a VM (and Linux Mint on my hardware) and both times something breaks on me. And I try to usually do the same stuff on both systems.

For me, debian based distributions have never been stable. But that's just a personal opinion"

cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T11:58:50,"Yeah, DMs use xinitrc too"
johndoe,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T11:58:12,i don't have one; so when i type startx i just get into my DE
johndoe,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T11:58:01,although idk how that works with a login manager
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T11:57:30,"Actually yeah, that makes sense"
johndoe,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T11:54:00,y u no put it in your xinitrc so it just starts along with your x server start?
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T11:53:04,Can't I just check it the process exists?

Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T02:16:14,add it to the end of ~/.bashrc
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T02:15:54,just launch it at boot
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T02:15:40,But on boot?
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T02:15:30,"just don't minimize them, that should usually ensure they are kept active"
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T02:14:38,"Yeah, I guess.
So one last question. How can I cache apps that I use? Like Firefox. To reduce startup time. I tried writing a systemd unit file. Dunno why that didn't work."
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T02:13:20,that is good
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T02:13:17,for it's cache
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T02:13:13,so please let your system use as much ram as possible

cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:58:15,Yes
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:58:03,disk/swap
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:57:36,"I think what you want is different,  you want cache to be always force used from disk ?"
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:57:29,Maybe. I didn't look into that at that time. Lemme fill up my RAM to see if it starts swapping
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:57:01,"as in mem filled, some cache moved ot swap... mem freed up?"
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:56:28,maybe it(physical mem) was cleared cause of the swap
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:56:16,"Use ""the great suspender"" extn to suspend tabs in chrome. @cocoa1231"
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:55:29,But I've used this on my old Ubuntu installations. I increased vm.swappiness up to 100 and it used to swap even if the memory wasn't completely full
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:54:57,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swappiness
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:54:34,only in that condition would this variable really take effect I think... would need to read up more about it to confirm
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:54:03,so swapping only happens when physical  memory is out of available cache space
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:53:46,"in which case, it would be, ""When 100% memory is used, then start swapping"""
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:53:24,"I thought it was ""When vm.swappiness% memory is used, then start swapping"""
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:52:59,however
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:52:52,you are already at the right setting for that then
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:52:42,vm.swappiness = 100   The kernel will swap aggressively.
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:51:38,Won't be the first time...
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:51:27,your machine will become unresponsive
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:51:25,"I know, but still wanna take a stab at it"
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:51:12,cause your ram is orders of magnitude faster and swapping won't really help but slow the machine down
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:50:56,I wanna see how it goes when it's swapping everything
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:50:39,you should always keep it to minimum
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:49:55,"The kernel will swap only to avoid an out of memory condition, when free memory will be below vm.min_free_kbytes limit. See the ""VM Sysctl documentation"". vm.swappiness = 1. Kernel version 3.5 and over, as well as Red Hat kernel version 2.6.32-303 and over: Minimum amount of swapping without disabling it entirely."
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:49:31,That's how it works?
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:49:28,it is always preferrable to use ram over swap
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:49:26,right?
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:49:24,or closer to that..
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:49:16,Oh shit.. I should have set it to 0
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:48:50,cause your physical ram is not full yet
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:48:41,swap used: 188K
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:48:32,"like, at all"
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:48:29,But it's not swapping
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:48:24,My vm.swappiness is set to 100
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-18T01:46:32,Yeah

cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-10T22:23:49,"I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called 'Linux', and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called 'Linux' distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux."

Nikhil_Warke,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T12:50:16,Check out Encryptr. It isn't as convenient as lastpass but is more secure

Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T12:46:19,he would need some time to deliver a proper  talk and as of now we only have lightning talks

Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T12:14:40,@mfrw1 would deliver docker talk on next to next meetup
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T12:06:37,Why cram everything into one meetup ?
Harry_Copter_(üöÅ),ILUG-D,2017-05-02T12:05:01,Let me call you for a quick chat shortly
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T12:03:17,Have exams tomorrow
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T12:02:32,"3rd of may is tomorrow. Please try to confirm your talk by today. Also, mention the duration. :)"
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T12:01:01,"I will confirm my talk and content by 3rd of may. If no slots, will give next time. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T11:59:25,Okay
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T11:59:09,god we can have multiple small lightning talks :)
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T11:58:39,We have more including Vijay Prakash and @mfrw1
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T11:56:34,I gave the wrong link for Virtual box though. I'll fix that
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T11:56:14,I created the issue
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T11:27:33,"Oops. My bad. Obviously we can have short talks. If the speakers are allright with it, I dont think that would be much of a problem."
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T11:21:55,why do the talks have to be 1 hour ?
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T11:19:19,That would mean we can only have 2 one hour talks at most.
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T11:15:50,Jon it would be just one hour session  in the begining
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T11:15:12,Would request everyone mentioned on this to please open an issue if you haven't already done so. https://github.com/ILUGD/talks/issues
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T11:13:03,"Okay. So, will the session go in parallel with the talks ? Since we have 4 talks."
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T11:11:53,Let's announce in other communities about this session
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T11:11:38,Obviously they can.
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T11:11:05,ILUGD is not avers3 to people from other communities coming to their meetup are they?
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T11:10:32,Yes. And now we seem to have many more talks lined up this saturday. Which is awesome !!!
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T11:10:26,People from other communities can come too
Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T11:07:57,I think it would make sense if people from this community are into data science. We should put this to vote. :)
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T10:49:32,I am thinking my topic would be: Linux new sites and forums: a disussion on where you can find the news resources and forums to help you out with Q&A around linux
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T10:46:42,@harrycopter how about a talk on linux mount point/ directory structure ?
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T10:45:28,@warlord77 @tk_sourabh need the same from you
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T10:45:15,@harrycopter @cocoa1231 what is the topic of your talks?
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T10:44:50,now don't try to remove these people from the talk list or I expect @akash47 and @mysticTot to be added to the list of people to give talks too.
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T10:44:06,"@akash47 @mysticTot @warlord77 we had 4 people comfirm their talks last time for the upcoming meetup, I talked with them, it was @cocoa1231 @tk_sourabh @warlord77 @harrycopter and me"
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T10:42:27,@jnxd91 would you be interested to be there for these talks ?
Quanon,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T10:42:04,"frist session for next ILUG-D meetup would be the collaboration talks with JNU, where people from JNU who are into Data science/machine learning woudl talk with people from ILUg-D who are into the same, try and find out ways to collaborate."
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T07:33:26,?

T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T01:30:27,So change the template to add tracks in place of desired audience?
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T01:29:33,"ya, this will help us to involve new users like college and school students. Exceptions added @cocoa1231 @MSFJarvis @arcsaber  and others"
cocoa,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T01:28:20,Okay cool
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T01:28:07,i mean level of talks. for every meetup we would have these two tracks
Shyam_Saini,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T01:26:31,"here by beginner i mean things for new linux users like shell scripting, processes etc"
T_K_Sourabh,ILUG-D,2017-05-02T01:25:47,You mean desired audience?

Akash_Mishra,ILUG-D,2017-05-01T22:29:32,Yes. It should be a separate talk. Anyone else?

Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-04-30T23:58:44,Very Soon Jolla would be releasing an official SFOS port for a few Sony Xperia devices. That would be great as it will combine a high end smartphone along with SFOS unlike mine.
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-04-30T23:57:07,But you can get refurbished devices on eBay or Flipkart probably.
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-04-30T23:56:42,Well no new device is up for sale now.

Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-04-30T23:55:46,Using android now feels sluggish to me
Raju_/_‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•Å,ILUG-D,2017-04-30T23:54:59,I chose it over a better spec android phone that I had earlier. It's not like I am locked to using it.
Harsh_Shandilya,ILUG-D,2017-04-30T23:50:12,even if it'll only last till I have a device tree going
Harsh_Shandilya,ILUG-D,2017-04-30T23:49:55,that's like the only scenario where you can make me use it

Guneet,ILUG-D,2017-04-20T18:51:23,How about deploying this on a different server and then trying the same request from your computer
Guneet,ILUG-D,2017-04-20T18:49:11,Confusing. It could just be some firewall between your local network and linode. But also if this was clearly a networking issue with linode then this problem being limited to one or two files is highly unlikely
Tavish,ILUG-D,2017-04-20T18:46:29,"on my machine it stops midway, and the client's TCP connection doesn't close, so it keeps waiting and times out"

Guneet,ILUG-D,2017-04-20T18:40:09,"And a curl or wget from a different network also doesn't work, is that correct?"
Tavish,ILUG-D,2017-04-20T18:37:26,nginx says 'client prematurely closed connection (104: Connection reset by peer) while sending response to client'

Mannu,ILUG-D,2017-04-19T12:20:11,"Many good initiatives by students in the form of project is presently going   un-noticed because of lack of awareness. If a common knowledge platform (with a facility for plagiarism) is created to bring all project works taken up at various levels by the students in Technical  / Higher Educational Institutes and Universities throughout the country , then it will be a great source of knowledge and also will help the student community to take up unique/innovative project works.Provision of Knowledge platform in which the entire data base of all the projects taken up by all Technical/Higher Educational Institutes/ Universities throughout the country by interlinking will be extremely useful."

Harry_Copter_(üöÅ),ILUG-D,2017-04-19T11:57:34,I believe such events and the project idea that solves identified problems of the country do count... So do people working on that piece of work...

Even the kernel wasn't loaded, so the computer had no way of knowing that another display was connected. This is just a guess though"

Harry_Copter_(üöÅ),ILUG-D,2017-04-13T07:33:32,When's next ilugd meeting?
Sahil,ILUG-D,2017-04-13T07:32:07,+1 @harrycopter  make a issue about the topic you want to give talk on at ilugd github repo
Harry_Copter_(üöÅ),ILUG-D,2017-04-13T07:27:48,Let me know your view
Harry_Copter_(üöÅ),ILUG-D,2017-04-13T07:27:02,It's like exercising before the big game... The big players keep doing small exercises regularly to keep fit for the big game...
Harry_Copter_(üöÅ),ILUG-D,2017-04-13T07:24:17,"I believe if we cover something basic and easy, people will carry some learning... For which they probably never found time... They didn't do the RTFM stuff..."
Harry_Copter_(üöÅ),ILUG-D,2017-04-13T07:22:43,That's my opinion and I may be sounding rude
Harry_Copter_(üöÅ),ILUG-D,2017-04-13T07:22:11,I find that we need to cover some easy and basic topics too... People don't even know basics as far as any Unix is concerned...
